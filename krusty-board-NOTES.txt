   -- basically, since its gotten quite complex functionality wise, wanted to start noting what all there is to go through everytime there's substantial changes, to make sure things are mostly ok

      d- layer-2 functionality
         d- basic layer 2 functionality for moving caret left/right/up/down/pgup/pgdn/home/end
            d- basically done by holding capslock down and trying out the j/k/i/m/h/l/,/u etc keys
         d- all that in caret selection mode (r held down)
         d- all that in caret deletion mode  (d held down)
         d- all that in double speed mode (. held down), double-speed only applies to left/right, the rest should work normal
         d- all that in by-word mode (alt held down), left/right should nav by word (as if ctrl was held down), rest normal

      d- caps to shift mapping (for 6, 7, 8, 9, 0, -, =, [, ], \, ;, ' keys)

      d- caps to ctrl mapping (for a, s, f, w, t, y, z, x, c, v, n, o, p keys)

      d- r-alt as shift (general remapping, should work for basically all characters)

      d- back-tick (`) as delete, caps-backtick for actual backtick, and ralt-backtick for ~ (its natural shift char)

      d- space
         d- r-alt_space as enter
         d- caps-space as ctrl-space (e.g. for intellij)
         d- caps-lalt-space as alt-enter (for intellij)

      - misc other key combos
         d- win-n : chrome new
         d- caps-alt-o as ctrl-alt-o for intellij, (and in general, other caps-as-ctrl maps as  alt-caps as alt-ctrl too)

      d- alt-tab
         d- shouldnt be screwy for normal usage first of all,
         d- should be accessible via caps-alt-wheel too
         d- should now have mouse wheel scroll even w/o caps pressed (needs alt-tab window type recognition)

      - switche
         d- right-mouse-btn and wheel should bring up and operate switche task switcher
         d- F1 should bring up and operate the task switcher too (and wheel would continue to work there ofc)
         d- Alt-1/Alt-tilde etc for quick-next-switch w/o bringing up switche window

      d- left-mouse-btn
         d- with caps should behave as ctrl for clicks
         d- with caps should modify drag-drop behavior to act like ctrl (show + btn, copy instead of move etc)

      d- mouse X1-btn and X2-btns
         d- should behave like middle mouse btn

      - mouse-wheel
         d- with caps, should behave like ctrl-wheel .. e.g. zoom in/out etc
         d- with alt, should control volume
         d- with caps-alt should bring-up and operate alt-tab
         d- with caps-win should control laptop brightness
         d- event spacing, repeat supression on action change (e.g. to prevent zoom etc from inertial wheels continuting to spin)

      - window move behaviors (call it layer-3 ?)
         d- access window-move behavior with caps-win (with j/k/i/m/n/u/,/;,h keys like for layer-2)
         d- [j k i ,] should move active window left/right, up/down
         d- [h ; o .] should make active window wider/narrower, taller/shorter (where possible)
         d- [m u] should toggle active window maximize and vert-maximize (where possible)

      - media / volume
         d- alt-f1 for play/pause, also caps-f1 should mute it (f1 picked coz it has that symbol on Fn row)
         d- alt-f2 for next (with some initial skip)
         d- alt-f3 for skip forward a bit
         d- alt-2 / alt-3 for vol up down
         d- also from above, alt-wheel for vol up down

      - monitor brightness
         d- from above, caps-alt-wheel for brightness up/down
         d- win-2/3 for brightness (mirroring alt-2/3 for volume)

   - so will add more notes here re background and other stuff that'll be forgotten, but for now, wanted to note testing notes
